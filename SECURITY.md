## Threat model

`bumblebee` is a read-only filesystem walker. It:

- does not execute discovered packages,
- does not download package contents or fetch threat intelligence at
  runtime,
- does not parse source code,
- does not require elevated privileges.

Scans run with the privileges of the invoking user. Exposure catalogs
supplied via `--exposure-catalog` are treated as trusted operator input;
the operator is responsible for the integrity of the catalog file.
