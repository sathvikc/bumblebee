# Threat Intelligence Exposure Catalogs

Maintained exposure catalogs for recent supply-chain campaigns, built from
public threat-intelligence reporting with
[Perplexity Computer](https://www.perplexity.ai/computer) and updated via
PRs as fresh campaigns are reported.

Pass a catalog to a scan with `--exposure-catalog <path>`. Review
the entries against current advisories before production use.
